# Cable and DSL Connections

Most home network users do not connect to their service providers with fiber-optic cables. The figure illustrates common connection options for small office and home users. The two most common methods are as follows:

    1. Cable:  - Typically offered by cable television service providers, the internet data signal is carried on the same coaxial cable that delivers cable television. 
               - It provides a high bandwidth, always in, connection to the internet. 
               - A special cable modem separates the internet data signal from the other signals carried on the cable and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.
    
    2. DSL:    - Digital Subscriber Line provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. 
               - It requires a special high-speed modem that separates the DSL signal from the telephone signal and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.                
               - DSL runs over a telephone line, with the line split into three channels. 
               - One channel is used for voice telephone calls. 
               - This channel allows an individual to receive phone calls without disconnecting from the internet. 
               - A second channel is a faster download channel, used to receive information from the internet. 
               - The third channel is used for sending or uploading information. 
               - This channel is usually slightly slower than the download channel. 
               - The quality and speed of the DSL connection depends mainly on the quality of the phone line and the distance from the central office of your phone company.                  
               - The farther you are from the central office, the slower the connection.
